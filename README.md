requires node/npm.

run `npm install` to get all node modules downloaded.
then run `npm start`. this should get webpack-dev running. webpack should open a browser window by default and load the project.

`./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --open --mode development`


then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` on your browser.
